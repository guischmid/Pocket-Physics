# ðŸ“± Pocket Physics

**Pocket Physics** is a small iOS app to look up physics formulas and concepts â€“ built entirely as a passion project.

Iâ€™m building this app slowly in my free time to learn more about Swift, SwiftUI, and app development in general. Everythingâ€™s work in progress, experimental, and will likely change a lot.

## ðŸ§  What it does (or will do)

- Browse physics formulas by topic (Mechanics, Thermodynamics, etc.)
- See formula, explanation, and variable definitions
- Mark formulas as favorites
- Search by formula name or keyword

## ðŸ’¡ Why this exists

I always wanted a simple, clean app to quickly review physics concepts â€“ no login, no clutter, no nonsense. So I decided to build it myself. Open source, offline, and lightweight.

## ðŸ”§ Tech stack (planned)

- Swift + SwiftUI
- Local JSON file as data source
- MVVM architecture
- Optional Combine for state handling

## ðŸ›  Status

- [x] Project scaffolded
- [x] Basic screen structure and navigation in place
- [ ] Data model & sample formulas
- [ ] Detail view with formula & explanation
- [ ] Search and favorites
- [ ] Polish & release on the App Store someday, maybe ðŸ˜…

## ðŸ§ª Contributions

Right now, this is just me tinkering. Once the structure is more solid, I might open it up for contributions.
